Data Structures and algorithms

## The problem posed in this course
In this course, we we learned the different data structures that are commonly used to represent large amounts of data. The aim of this course was to investigate each one to find its strengths and weaknesses. At the end of the course, we had to perfoma an analysis of the structures and pick one as the solution to the representation of the courses data problem

## Approach
The main approach was to examine each of the data structures. Using this analysis, I was able to pick the binary search tree. From my analysis, I found that at lower amounts of data, the binary search tree was the most efficient.

## Roadblocks
I didn't encounter any significant roadblocks. There were some instances where the code did not run correctly and I had to debug it. But given a solid understanding of the data structure, debugging is not overly difficult.

## Looking ahead
I had heard the names of these data structures before, but never understood them. After taking this course and completing the assignments, I feel that I can select and apply any data structure efectively to represent a set of data. When developing future applications, knowledge of data stuctures and algorithms is an addition of a powerful tool to my toolset.

## Evolution
When creating these structures in the IDE, it's important to keep everything organized and classified. As the data points become larger, the objects that represent them become larger. This is going to likely result in a large class. It's important to organize the code so that it is easy to read, understand, debug, and modify the class that represents the data. Otherwise, you're doing yourself and other developers a disservice. A part of that is classification. Naming is one of the most difficult tasks when it comes to building something like this from scratch. Having specific, descriptive names helps prevent confusion and obscurity. In any future code I write, I will keep these in mind and try to keep quality and cleanliness a priority.
